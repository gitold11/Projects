    <h2 class="center">Intro</h2>
    <p>Daniel Gerhard Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller novels, including the
        Robert Langdon novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013),
        and Origin (2017). His novels are treasure hunts which usually take place over a period of 24 hours. They
        feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57
        languages and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code,
        and Inferno, have been adapted into films.

        The Robert Langdon novels are deeply engaged with Christian themes and historical fiction, and have generated
        controversy as a result. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian and he is on a
        "constant spiritual journey" himself. He claims that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply "an entertaining
        story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate" and suggests that the book may be used "as a positive
        catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith."

    <h2 class="center">Early life</h2>
    <p>Dan Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire. He has a younger sister, Valerie (born
        1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1974). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade. He grew
        up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics
        and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997. His mother, Constance (n√©e Gerhard), trained
        as a church organist and student of sacred music. Brown was raised an Episcopalian, and described his
        religious evolution in a 2009 interview:

        "I was raised Episcopalian, and I was very religious as a kid. Then, in eighth or ninth grade, I studied
        astronomy, cosmology, and the origins of the universe. I remember saying to a minister, 'I don't get it. I read
        a book that said there was an explosion known as the Big Bang, but here it says God created heaven and Earth and
        the animals in seven days. Which is right?' Unfortunately, the response I got was, 'Nice boys don't ask that
        question.' A light went off, and I said, 'The Bible doesn't make sense. Science makes much more sense to me.'
        And I just gravitated away from religion."
